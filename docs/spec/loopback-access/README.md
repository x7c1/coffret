# Loopback Access

Rule prefix: `LA`. Who a server serving a Library answers, and how it knows:
the interface it listens on, the key it draws as it starts and publishes into
the Library's own directory, and the fences every request passes before a
route sees it.

Concept background: [Library](../../concepts/library/),
[Passphrase](../../concepts/passphrase/).

## Rules

- **LA-1.** A server serving a Library listens on the loopback interface
  alone, so the Library's plaintext is never offered to another machine on
  the network. *(Form: prose — a property of the address the binary binds,
  which no test over the server's own answers can observe; honored by
  construction and review.)*
- **LA-2.** Reaching that socket is not authorization. Every request is
  authorized before any route sees it, reads exactly as mutations are,
  because what a read answers with is the Library. *(Form: test)*
- **LA-3.** The server draws a key as it starts, from the operating system's
  CSPRNG, and writes it owner-only into the Library's own directory on this
  device. A caller shows it in a header. The boundary is therefore the
  operating system's file permissions: a caller that can read the file is a
  process of the account that owns the Library, and a page in a browser is
  not one. *(Form: test)*
- **LA-4.** The key is one running process's. It is drawn afresh at every
  start and nothing carries from one process to the next, so a key that
  leaked is spent when its server stops and a file a killed server left
  behind admits nobody. *(Form: test)*
- **LA-5.** A request is admitted only where it names the authority the
  server actually bound, carries that key, and does not admit to coming from
  another site. A key that is shown and is wrong is answered exactly as no
  key at all, and the refusal names neither the key shown nor the one
  expected. *(Form: test)*
- **LA-6.** The key is never on a URL and never in a cookie: a URL is written
  down in referrers, histories and access logs, and a cookie is attached by
  the browser to requests the page never made — which is what LA-5's third
  fence exists against. *(Form: test)*
- **LA-7.** The shown key is compared against the expected one without
  stopping at the first byte that differs. *(Form: prose — a timing property
  of one comparison, which no test over the verdict can observe; honored by
  construction.)*
